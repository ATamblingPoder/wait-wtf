# 00 
Boot the image in vmware.
Open the terminal in Ubuntu (wink, wink, there's a nice and handy shortcut for this)

# The terminal always opens in Vim.
Figure out how to exit Vim.
Stop making the process run whenever a new terminal session is opened.

# I can't access the internet?
yes, there must be a way to find out what's wrong here.

## wait, wtf happened to sudo?
Users can run commands and some commands require root permissions ("Admin access"). 
You can run these commands by adding a `sudo` before the command which means run whatever follows as root. # to-do this sounds so weird
**`sudo` has been replaced with `wtf`.**

# Shut it, Firefox.
You may have noticed this already but a new Firefox session keeps on opening every minute. What's up with that?
hint: `crontab`

# End-Sem Project
Someone from college has [this](https://github.com/exitflynn/cool-repo) github repo. For some random reason, you want to make a copy of the files and make sure they're running smoothly. 
Clone the github repository. Open the folder in a text editor. There'll be two files, one written in the C programming language and the other in emojicode. Figure out how to run them, and if there's an error (which'll most definitely be), find and fix it.

# Giddy-Up
I was working on a project, when two dudes going by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone got down from a helicopter and deleted my life's work. Little did they know, I was prepared for such encounters. I had been using `git` to track changes to my files and I still have the .git folder left over. Can you (PLEASE) find a way to recover everything I worked on from the .git folder?
